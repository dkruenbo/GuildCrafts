# GuildCrafts — Project Notes for AI Assistants

## What this project is

WoW TBC Anniversary addon (Interface 20505). Lua, AceAddon-3.0 framework.
Tracks guild members' profession recipes and syncs them across all addon users
via a DR/BDR election system over the GUILD addon message channel.

---

## Build & Release

### Zip a release
Always exclude `.DS_Store` — macOS creates it whenever Finder opens the folder:

```bash
zip -r GuildCrafts-X.Y.Z.zip GuildCrafts/ -x "*.DS_Store"
```

### Version bump checklist
Three places must match before committing a version bump:

| File | Field |
|---|---|
| `GuildCrafts/Core.lua` | `GuildCrafts.DISPLAY_VERSION = "X.Y.Z"` |
| `GuildCrafts/GuildCrafts.toc` | `## Version: X.Y.Z` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` |

`GuildCrafts.VERSION` (integer) and `GuildCrafts.DATA_FORMAT_VERSION` (integer)
are wire protocol versions — only increment when the sync protocol changes.
Currently both are `2`.

---

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/patch-N-description`
- PRs are **squash-merged** into `main`, branch deleted after merge
- Force-push to feature branches is fine (they're never shared before PR)
- After a rebase, use `git push --force-with-lease`

### Important
Never commit, push, create a PR, or merge without explicit instruction from the user.

### Full ship sequence for a patch

```bash
git push -u origin feature/patch-N-description
gh pr create --title "feat: ..." --base main
gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch --subject "feat: ..."
zip -r GuildCrafts-X.Y.Z.zip GuildCrafts/ -x "*.DS_Store"
```

## CHANGELOG Conventions

- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Sections: `### New features`, `### Improvements`, `### Fixes`

---

## Architecture Quick Reference

- **DR** (Designated Router): alphabetically first addon user; answers all
  `SYNC_REQUEST`s and broadcasts `HEARTBEAT` every 60s
- **BDR** (Backup DR): second alphabetically; responds at retry=1
- `syncRetryCount`: 0 = ask DR, 1 = ask BDR, 2 = evict both and re-elect
- `currentTerm`: monotone integer incremented on DR promotion; stale messages
  (term < currentTerm) are silently dropped
- `SyncPausePolicy`: suspends all outgoing sync during combat, instances, and
  zone transitions (grace periods: 6s / 15s / 12s)
- Chunked transfers: one chunk per second via timer, `SYNC_CHUNK_SIZE = 5`
  members per chunk; Patch 3 adds sessionId + RESUME recovery

## Key Constants (Comms.lua)

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SYNC_TIMEOUT` | 120s | Wait for SYNC_RESPONSE before retry |
| `SYNC_RETRY_TIMEOUT` | 15s | Wait on subsequent retries |
| `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` | 180s | 3 missed heartbeats → DR presumed dead |
| `PROGRESS_TIMEOUT` | 4s | Chunk gap before sending RESUME |
| `SESSION_TTL` | 35s | How long sender keeps chunk cache |
| `MAX_RESUME_ATTEMPTS` | 3 | RESUME tries before falling back to full retry |

## Planned Work

`spec/implementation-plan-v2.md` is the source of truth for all planned patches.

Current status:
- ✅ Patch 1 — SyncPausePolicy + Partial Scan Protection (v1.4.0)
- ✅ Patch 2 — DELTA_AD broadcast (v1.5.0)
- ✅ Patch 3 — Chunk RESUME recovery (v1.6.0)
- ⏳ Patch 4 — Per-peer backoff (v1.7.0) — branch: `feature/patch-4-per-peer-backoff`
- ⏳ Patch 5 — Tombstone pruning + [>]→[G] rename (v1.8.0)

## No Automated Tests

There is no test suite. Verification is manual in-game. Key things to check
after any sync-layer change: `/gc comms` debug output, chunk delivery in a
multi-user guild session, role election log.
